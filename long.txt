1.Minerals And Classification :-
	
ANS = Metal are naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition. metal are classified into two types on the basis of composition. these are -

	(i)metallic minerals -these minerals contain metal in Raw form. they are hard substance that 		conduct heat and electricity and have characteristic of luster.these are further divided into 		two types-

		(a) Furious mineral- with which contain iron are Furious metallic mineral example iron 		ore manganese etc

		(b) non Furious- minerals which does not contain iron or non Furious metallic minerals 		example gold copper extra 

	(ii)non metallic- mineral does not contain metal example limestone Mica exactra

2.Convectional and non-convectional:-

Distinguish = Ans = Conventional sources of energy are those which have been in common use for a long 		    time. firewood and fossil fuel are to main example of conventional energy 				    sources.

		 Non conventional are those energy which is renewable and does not harm environment. 			 example solar energy wind energy etc

Why use nonconvectional = ANS = 
->The increasing use of fossil fuel is leading to their shortage.
->  if the present rate of their consumption continuous they are reserve will get exhausted in near future 
-> their use causes and environment pollution
-> hence there is need for non conventional energy like solar energy wind energy etc which are renewable
